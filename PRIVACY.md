# Privacy Policy

This project respects your privacy. We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) in open form. Specifically:

- **No personal data**: We do not store email addresses, phone numbers, or names in plain text. Submissions for polls or census forms are processed into salted hashes to ensure uniqueness without revealing identity.
- **Commitments & hashes**: Participation tokens and ballots are represented by salted SHA-256 hashes. These hashes allow you to verify that your vote or entry was counted without exposing personal information.
- **Aggregated data**: Only aggregated statistics are published. Raw submissions with personal details are excluded or anonymised.
- **Deletion**: If you wish to remove your data or have concerns about privacy, contact the maintainers via GitHub issues or the listed contact channel. We will remove your record and associated hash from future publications.

By participating, you agree to these terms and acknowledge that the platform is experimental and community-driven.
